Free utilities for learning and using the CharaChorder Master Forge keyboard

This is a new kind of keyboard, where each of 16 switches can move in 5 different directions in 3D space. Check out [https://charachorder.com](https://docs.charachorder.com/Master%20Forge.html#learning-the-layout) for more information.

## Learning to type

This is argubly the biggest hurdle to getting productive with this keyboard.

To learn a new layout, you need to have some kind of quick reference.

The official reference card/graphic, including on the very nice desktop mat that came with my delivery, was typeset and laid out by someone with a lot more skill than me...

But it's in very small print, and I can't for the life of me use it to find my way around. It's not *glanceable* (for me).

In addition, the thumb switches are on a different plane, kind of 'sideways' and I kept activating the thumb switch in the wrong direction.

To solve both of these, I came up with a new graphic in OmniGraffle.

1. It uses much bigger characters and symbols to indicate key positions. Capital letters too (even though, technically, you are entering lowercase characters unless you add Shift)

2. The thumb markings are in a pseudo-3D arrangement that makes it obvious which direction does what.

This prints on a standard Letter size page and is suitable for taping underneath your monitor.

Compare this with the layout avaialable at the bottom of the learning app at https://www.iq-eq.io/#/ (which as of writing, doesn't yet have a Master Forge layout, though the CharaChorder One layout is quite similar).

I give permission for anyone to use this for any purpose whatsoever. I hope it helps you learn. -M.J
